> ... have a `<main>` element as a first child of the `<body>`
- [x] change the `div.container` into a `<main>` element


> for a card, `<article>` is often a decent choice and it definitely would suit here, you can also have `<sections>` within the article. 
- [x] change `<section>` into `<article>` and vice versa 

> The list of stats would be a good opportunity to use <ul> as it is a list
- [x] change the `.stats` part into `<ul>`

> I would modify the media query so the card is in a column layout for a little bit longer, there isn't quite enough space for the two halves to be next to each other at 673px
- [x] change max-width
> the background image repeats at this width
- [x] set `background-repeat` to `no-repeat`
