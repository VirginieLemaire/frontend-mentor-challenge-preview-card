# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

I started this challenge to pratice CSS as I'm a beginner : not  confident in web integration.... So it's a good exercise ;)

This is my solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). 

## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Tried to use semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (Flexbox)

### What I learned

I learned to insert a colored picture !

It was a good exercise to practice and remember the step to make an integration. As I dont have a pro account, I had to guess to sizes, margins etc. So it took me time... But no matter, that was the aim of practicing!

#### => **After submitting my solution**

Thanks to the advices given by the community I learned :

- CSS property "[background-blend-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/background-blend-mode)"
- CSS [multi-column layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns/Using_multi-column_layouts)
- better use of semantic HTML

### Continued development

As I said, I still have to code the mobile design to practice the responsive design.

### Useful resources

- for the colored picture I inspired myself from this [MDN page about linear-gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/background-image)
